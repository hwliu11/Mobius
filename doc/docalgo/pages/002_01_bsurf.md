=========================

# Control net

The following figure illustrates the indexation of a control
net for a B-surface \f$\textbf{s}(u,v)\f$:

Internally, the control net is organized as a matrix represented by two nested
standard C++ vectors (std::vector). The rows of this matrix correspond to
isovalues in U direction. The cols in this matrix correspond to the isovalues
in V direction.

# Point inversion

Point inversion is a fundamental algorithm which allows obtaining a preimage
of a 3D point in the parametric domain of a surface. In essence, point inversion
is equivalent to point projection. The mathematical formulation of the point
inversion problem is given in \ref piegl-tiller-1995 "The NURBS Book". The following
picture illustrates the poles of a control net projected to the B-surface using
the point inversion technique (the projected points are denoted with green color).

There are some important notes on the proper implementation of the Newton iterations
for point inversion.

- The search space is constrained with `U_min`, `U_max`, `V_min` and `V_max`
  extremities of a B-surface. If the next test point of the Newton iteration falls
  outside the domain, the corresponding coordinate is snapped to its extremity.
  Without such a snapping, the values of the objective function may grow
  unexpectedly.

- If the search space is constrained as mentioned above, then the objective
  functions are often non-minimizable because they express the cosine whose
  values are sometimes geometrically restricted from being zeros (think of a border point
  whose projection cannot be orthogonal). In such cases, the algorithm
  cannot converge to an unconstrained minimum. Therefore, the stop criterion to
  use is not only the value of a function (which should ideally become zero) but also the
  step size in the search space.

- The Newton iterations perform the local search. Therefore, it is necessary
  to properly choose the initial guess. If the point inversion process always
  starts from a randomly picked point (e.g., the simplest way of choosing the
  initial guess is to pick up the midpoint of the surface in its domain), the
  local search may take the solution far from the desired one. In the worst case,
  it may even diverge. An example of a formally correct but unsuitable solution
  of point inversion is shown in the figure above. Intuitively, we expect the
  projected point to lie as close to the origin point as possible.
  To fit this requirement, the local search should be accompanied by a wise global search.
  Fortunately, for B-spline surfaces, the global search is quite straightforward. It
  may consist in picking up the control pole closest to the point being inverted
  and taking the midpoint of its support subdomain (whose size is dependent on
  the spline degrees).

The point inversion algorithm is implemented in mobius::geom_BSplineSurface
class.

Mobius supports kernel-agnostic JSON-representations of B-surfaces. You can
obtain these dumps from \ref asitus2017 "Analysis Situs" interactively or
specify geometry manually (like this is done in mobius::test_BSplineSurface test
functions).
