Surface mesh {#smesh}
======================

Mesh data structure of Mobius is inspired by paper
\ref botsch2002 "[Botsch et al. 2002]" which describes the OpenMesh framework.
To avoid external dependencies, we decided to implement yet another simple
half-edge data structure for meshes. It generally reproduces the elements of
OpenMesh, but we do not claim the same level of efficiency and generality.
So in case if you are seeking for a data structure for polygonal geometric
modeling, consider using OpenMesh in the first place. Now we describe the main
principles.

In vertex, a pointer to the outgoing half-edge is stored as
illustrated by the picture below.

A face references one of its bounding half-edges.

The data structure is essentially edge-oriented. A half-edge references

- the vertex it points to,
- the face it belongs to,
- the opposite half-edge,
- the next half-edge in counter-clockwise order,
- the previous half-edge.

The following figure illustrates the pointers owned by a half-edge.
